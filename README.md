# jtball-js
Volleyball game for browsers (html5 + js). Was never finished, but can be played (early access quality...). 

Features:
* Very simple AI implemented, difficulty could be modified from code but not runtime
* Keeps score
* Time manipulation "bullet time" effect when aiming the shot

Basically tries to be "improved" version of good old [Arcade Volleyball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_Volleyball) but is in current shape it is lacking too much. Needs work to be taken seriously as a game.

## Play
Play against the AI using keys A S D (desktop) or using touchscreen (mobile):
